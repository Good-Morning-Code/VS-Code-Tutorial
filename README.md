## What is Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code, or VS Code for short, is a code editor. Code editors are software that allow you to write and edit code, and many offer tools that allow you to run your code in a browser or wherever your code needs to run. Visual Studio Code is a great option for a code editor, especially for those looking to get into code, because it has great community support, it's easy to setup, and it has a lot of amazing features.

## How to install Visual Studio Code

* Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/
* Either click `Download` in the top right corner, or click the `Download {your os here}` button found in the middle of the landing page.
* Mac Users: Once downloaded, move the application from the `downloads` folder to the `applications` folder. This is important! If you don't do this, settings you choose on VS Code will not be saved.
* Recommended: Create a shortcut for VS Code on your desktop or toolbar

## Using Visual Studio Code

Once VS Code is installed, open the program. On the left you will see a few icons. Here is a basic rundown of what they are for:

### File explorer

The file explorer allows you to view the files in your codebase, as well as add files. When starting a code project, I highly recommend creating a folder and opening it in VS Code.

### Search

![Search](/images/search.png)

The search tab allows you to search for pieces of code within your codebase (NOT searching files, but actual code). This is particularly useful for finding code in large codebases.

### Git Management

The Git management tab allows you to work with git directly within the VS Code user interface. While you will most likely use git primarily through the terminal, this tab is also useful for viewing changes you've made to your codebase as compared to previous versions. If you haven't learned git yet, don't worry, we will get there soon!

### Debugger

The debugger tab allows you to run debugging tools in your code. Like with git, we will get there soon, so don't worry about this tab too much yet.

### Extensions

The extensions tab lets you browse and install VS Code extensions. Extensions are one of the most valuable parts of VS Code, so take advantage of this section! A couple popular extensions are:

* Prettier
* Theme extensions (search theme and see what's there!)

## Visual Code Shortcuts

Since you will be spending a lot of time in VS Code, it's important for you to get as comfortable with it as possible. I recommend getting comfortable with the keyboard shortcuts for your operating system:

* Windows: https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf
